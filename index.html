      <h1>About Me</h1>
      Hello there! My name is Sohil Doshi. I am currently a junior in high school and am interested in mathematics, physics, computer science, and tennis.
        <li>Mathematics: I always liked working with numbers and finding patterns so naturally I was interested in mathematics. I do both competitive mathematics and higher mathematics, and I am particular interested in Number Theory and Algebra.
        <li>Physics: Physics is perhaps my favorite subject as I am able to apply the concepts I learn in mathematics to the real world. I have a particular interest in astrophysics and would like to understand the origins of our universe and the vast cosmos. I also enjoy reading many books on physics, especially the ones written by Richard Feynman.</li>
        <li>Computer Science: Computer Science helps me get a better grasp of algorithms and how to apply them to solve problems.  </li>
        <li>Tennis: I am a huge tennis fan and I enjoy both watching and playing tennis. I like all players in the Big 3 but if I were to choose, my favorite tennis player would be Rafael Nadal.</li>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      I have taken classes in higher levels of mathematics and in most of those classes, I took notes and latexed them. Click <a href="notes.html" title="Notes">here</a> if you wish to look at them.
      <h1>To The Limit Maths (TTLM)</h1>
      I cofounded the nonprofit To The Limit Maths which is a tutoring organization that teaches competition and school math to students. We also make our own handouts and curriculum and as an added bonus, we also make contests and are currently in the process of making one. Click <a href="ttlm.html" title="To The Limit Maths">here</a> for more information.
      <h1>Book Reviews</h1>
      As a person, I always loved to read books. In the last few years, I have had the opportunity to read many interesting books. Cilck <a href="bookreview.html" title="Book Reviews">here</a> if you would like to see my thoughts on the books that I enjoyed reading.
