      <h1>About Me</h1>
      Hello there! My name is Sohil Doshi. I am currently a junior in high school and am interested in mathematics, physics, computer science, and tennis.
        <li>Mathematics: I always liked working with numbers and finding patterns so naturally I was interested in mathematics. I do both competitive mathematics and higher mathematics, and I am particular interested in Number Theory and Algebra.
        <li>Physics: Physics is perhaps my favorite subject as I am able to apply the concepts I learn in mathematics to the real world. I have a particular interest in astrophysics and would like to understand the origins of our universe and the vast cosmos. I also enjoy reading many books on physics, especially the ones written by Richard Feynman.</li>
        <li>Computer Science: Computer Science helps me get a better grasp of algorithms and how to apply them to solve problems.  </li>
        <li>Tennis: I am a huge tennis fan and I enjoy both watching and playing tennis. I like all players in the Big 3 but if I were to choose, my favorite tennis player would be Rafael Nadal.</li>
